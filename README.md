# Database Implementation:
Implemented the designed database schema using an appropriate relational database management system (MySQL).
Created database tables, indexes, and views to store and retrieve data efficiently.

# Data Manipulation and Querying:
Utilized SQL (Structured Query Language) to perform data manipulation operations, including INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, to manage user-generated content.
Developed complex SQL queries to extract specific information, such as posts with the highest engagement or users with the most followers.
